# Mars2020.github.io

This is one of my very first projects as a web developer. The aim is to recreate NASA's Mars Mission from 2020 wherein they gave a chance to the fill out a small form, then allow them to download the 'Boarding Pass'.
(Fun Fact: They printed all those names, over 10 million, onto a silicon wafer chip and flew them to mars on their Perseverence rover!)
This is a newbie's attempt to recreate the same website XD
